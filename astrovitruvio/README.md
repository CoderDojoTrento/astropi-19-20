How reliable is magnetic field data collected from Raspberry Pi on the ISS? We
wish to analyze and compare it to computer simulated values, based on the
current World Magnetic Model (WMM), at the same height as the ISS, about 400
km above Earth surface. We hope and expect to notice some incongruities from
the comparison. If this is the case, we will verify whether the change in the
magnetic field is an early consequence of earthquakes.
