Our experiment aims to determine how much the anthropic intervention, which has
endured over the decades, has influenced the global environment, by observing the
alteration of nature due to the construction of artificial lakes, the shrinking of natural
ones, and the exploitation of forests. We believe that it is an interesting project not
only because it allows us to see the health of vegetation today and in the past, but
also because we can make predictions about the health of the future Earth. We
expect to see a progressive deterioration and decrease in plant health and forests
that were previously remote and immaculate. Also, today we can reach and exploit
remote areas thanks to the technological progress in the last 35 years. Furthermore,
we expect to see a decline in vegetation where an environmental disaster has
occurred, both human and natural. We hope for sporadic reforestation in areas
corresponding to the presence of artificial lakes.
